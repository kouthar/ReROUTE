Features

# Coordinate (interface)
Fields
+ double pos: position of the object, from -30200 to 30200
Methods
+ double distanceTo(Coordinate other): return the distance from this object to other


# Train (implements Coordinate)
Fields
- static final double ACCELERATION: the acceleration of trains
+ double pos: position of the object, from -30200 to 30200
- int id: id of this train
- int capacity: maximum capacity of this train (with potential to exceed capacity with detriment to speed)
- int numPassengers: number of passengers onboard
- double speed: speed of this train right now
- Station nextStation: the next station the train is heading towards
Methods
+ accessors & mutators
+ double distanceToStation(): returns the distance to the next station
+ double distanceToTerminus(): returns the distance to the terminal station
+ int timeToStation(): returns the time, in seconds, to the next station


# Station (implements Coordinate)
Fields
+ double pos: position of the object, from -30200 to 30200
- int[] inflowRange: the minimum and maximum inflow
- int[] outflowRange: the minimum and maximum outflow
- String name: name of this station
- String id: id of this station
- Station nextStation: next station on the route, towards the positive direction
- Station previousStation: previous station on the route, backwards on the positive direction
Methods
+ accessors & mutators
+ double getTrainStopTime(): returns the stop time of each train at this station, depending on inflow & outflow
- int getInflow(): returns the inflow at this station
- int getOutflow(): returns the outflow at this station


# Terminus (extends Station)
Fields
Methods
- int getOutflow(): returns -1 to signify that all passengers get off at this terminus


# Depot (extends Station)
Fields
- int storage: number of trains stored at this depot
- final int capacity: maximum number of trains that can be stored at this depot
Methods
+ accessors & mutators
+ void sendTrain(): updates the storage for a train departure
+ void receiveTrain(): updates the storage for a train arrival


# Route
Fields
- ArrayList<Train> trains: list of trains on this route
- Station[] stations: list of stations on this route
Methods
+ accessors & mutators
+ Station getNextStation(Train train): returns the next station on the route
+ Station getPreviousStation(Train train): returns the last station on the route
- get - distanceTraveled, time, ETA, schedule, distanceToStation


# Person (implements Coordinate)
Fields
- stations boarded & alighted
- name (for fun)
- id
Methods
- distance travelled


# Control
Fields
- Route[] routes: list of routes in this metro system
Methods
+ void main(String[] args)


# GUI 
- animated representation of trains and the ATC model
- accelerated time for longer period shown
- using JFrame and Swing
- sprites of train (scaled down but same dimensions) & passenger (same ratio)
